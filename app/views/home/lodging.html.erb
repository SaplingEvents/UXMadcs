<h2>Madison Hostel</h2>
<p>Hostels are not for everyone and this one has common rooms and showers that might not be your cup of tea. However if you can get past a few details like that you can meet some excellent folks travelling the world and get your own bed to crash on for less than a dinner for two.</p>
